## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/CBTr6A6JoizBj8PNC-c3aQ), **without the help of Google**:

### General

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
